# Cyclistic Analysis
## Overview
This SQL script merges 12 monthly tables (e.g. tripdata_202404, tripdata_202405 etc.) into a single dataset using UNION.

## Goal

## Data Sources
The data is CSVs divided into months. I used the most recent 12 months of data.
The tables include data about bike rides including bike type; start and end time, station name and id, latitude and longitude; and membership status.
