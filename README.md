# Cyclistic Analysis
## Overview


## Goal
1. Discover how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently to inform the design of marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into
annual members.
## Data Sources
The data source is CSVs divided into months. I used the most recent 12 months of data (Apr 2024-Mar 2025).
The tables show data about bike rides including bike type; membership status; start and end time, station name, station id, latitude and longitude. Each record represents one bike ride.
