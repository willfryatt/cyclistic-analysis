# Cyclistic Analysis
## Overview
This SQL script merges 12 monthly tables (e.g. tripdata_202404, tripdata_202405 etc.) into a single dataset using UNION.

## Goal
1. Discover how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently to inform the design of marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into
annual members.
## Data Sources
The data source is CSVs divided into months. I used the most recent 12 months of data.
The tables show data about bike rides including bike type; membership status; start and end time, station name, station id, latitude and longitude. Each record represents one bike ride.
